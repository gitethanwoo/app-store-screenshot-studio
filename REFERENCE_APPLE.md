# Apple rules that commonly affect screenshots (practical checklist)

Use this when writing overlay copy, choosing which screens to show, and doing final QA.

## Accurate, up-to-date representation
- Your screenshots and overlay copy must reflect what the current version of the app actually does.
- Don't imply features, content, or outcomes the app doesn't provide.

## "App in use" requirement
- Screenshot sets should show the app being used (not only splash/title art).
- Avoid "login-only" sets unless the app is truly unusable without login AND you still show meaningful in-app screens.

## In-App Purchase / subscription clarity
- If a screenshot highlights a feature or content that requires subscription/IAP, disclose that in the screenshot copy (or otherwise clearly indicate it).

## No prices or keyword stuffing in screenshots
- Don't include prices or price-like claims in screenshots/overlays.
- Don't stuff trademarks, competitor app names, or irrelevant phrases.

## Suitable for a broad audience
- Keep screenshot imagery and overlay copy appropriate for a wide audience (even if the app has a higher age rating).

## Use fictional/demo data
- Use fake names/emails/messages.
- Don't show real people's personal data.

## Don't reference other platforms/marketplaces
- Avoid names/icons/imagery of other mobile platforms or app marketplaces in screenshots/metadata unless there is specific approved interactive functionality.

If you're unsure whether copy is risky (e.g., "best", "#1", "guaranteed"), rewrite to a verifiable, product-truth statement.
